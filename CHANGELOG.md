# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
We do not use Semantic Versioning, because our images are tagged based on Rust releases and nightly/build-dates.

For maximum stablity, use images with tags like `blackdex/rust-musl:aarch64-musl-1.96.0`, `blackdex/rust-musl:arm-musleabi-stable-1.96.0` or `blackdex/rust-musl:x86\_64-musl-nightly-2026-06-02`.<br>
These may occasionally be rebuilt, but only while they're "current", or possibly if they're recent and serious security issues are discovered in a library.

## 2026-07-25
  - Updated PostgreSQL to v15.19, v16.15, v17.11 and v18.6
  - Updated sccache to v0.17.0
  - Switched zlib download to GitHub


## 2026-07-25
  - Updated SQLite to v3.53.4
  - Fixed a strange bug found via Vaultwarden using a database backend over TLS/SSL.
    In the end it was an issue with the compilation of OpenSSL.
    Apparently if the configure state of OpenSSL finds `-static` inside the `LD_FLAGS` it runs `disable('static', 'pic', 'threads')`.
    This causes `threading` to be disabled, which in the end causes several weird issue in a sporadic way, and causes tools using it have issues.<br><br>
    A disclaimer for this specific fix, I used an LLM to troubleshoot this hard to figure-out issue. To be more precise, I used Claude Opus 5 for this.
    I only used it as a sparring partner, and it never ever edited any file, and I made all the changes my self after verifying.
    This helped me finding this issue in about 3 hours, while i might very well would have spend 3 days or more to find it because of all the changed parts on both this image, and both Vaultwarden and all the different crates it uses.


## 2026-07-21
  - Remove `config.toml` and use `CARGO_TARGET_` environment variables instead
  - Also add the `NM_<triple>` to point to the correct nm binary
  - Updated GHA


## 2026-06-26
  - Update SQLite to v3.53.3


## 2026-06-26
  - Adjusted the `toolchain.cmake` file to work with this image.
    If crates used cmake to build code, it could happen that it did not found the pre-compiled libraries.
    By creating a custom file which basically does the same as all `TARGET_` environment variables this works again.
    Tested this by building `mysqlclient-sys` using the `bundled` feature.

  - Updated GitHub Actions once they were available


## 2025-11-14

## 2025-02-18

### Added
  - Added `libpq` v17


## 2025-02-15

### Added
  - Build images for aarch64 (arm64) hosts. Now you can build x86_64 binaries on your Raspberry Pi.
  - Attest `rust-musl` container images so you can verify if the container is really build via GitHub via my repo


## 2024-11-26

### Removed
  - Removed `libpq` v11, it has been deprecated for a while now


## 2024-08-08

### Changed
  - `libpq` v16 is now the default version


## 2024-08-02

### Fixed
  - Possibility of wrong Postgres library being used.<br>
    In some situations it could be that the libpq v11 was still used. Depending if during the compilation of the code other crates added the main library path as a search path after `pq-sys` did, which caused rustc to use a different libpq.a.<br>
This has been solved now by moving the library file for v11 to a separate directory also. The default directory is changed and should not cause any issues unless you set the `PQ_LIB_DIR` variable your self to anything else then the v15 directory.


## 2024-03-15

### Changed
 - Stop adding `-openssl3` postfix to the tags

   They do not seem to be used at all. If someone is using them, please open an issue and let me know.
